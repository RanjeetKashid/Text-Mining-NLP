  The packaging used by Amazon was really good.Coming to the packaging of the watch itself, wow, the unboxing experience was comparable to that of APPLE products, really clean.And coming to the sensors, it has Heart rate and SpO2 sensors along with a 6 axis accelerometer.1. The Heart rate sensor works fines with a margin of error of 2-3 beats per min.2. The SpO2 sensor is not a gimmick, it works fine but not 100% accurate, it was of by nearly 2% every time.** Both the sensors do no work if  the watch is not on your hand**So both are just not for namesake and are functional.**It doesn't have GPS built-in the only CON at this price.**The display is pretty good and gets adequately bright.Coming to the battery charging time, it takes around 1.5hrs for 30-100%.***Update 1: The battery only lasts for 6 days, when HR set for continuous for every 10min, sleep tracking on and also notifications on for sedentary and calls and exercise tracking for 30 min a day.Checking SpO2 10 times a day manually and always on for stress measurement.Lifting the watch up to light the screen for nearly 50 times a day.I expected it to last for atleast 7 days though(claimed was 9 days).***UPDATE 2: Using it for nearly 2 weeks now , received a firmware upgrade, and the accuracy of the SpO2 as well as the HR sensor have improved and also the battery life has improved to around 7 days now.****UPDATE-3( 24th Jan 2021): Using it for almost 3 months now, I guess all the hugs ar fixed, most of the measruu are accurate, but the step counter sometimes registers steps even if I don't walk :P.Battery life on average 7 days with HR every 10 min and stress measurement on and daily once O2 measurement and sleep tracking.The band is pretty comfortable, no skin irritation or discomfort.Received around 6-7 updates till now.This watch is a good budget  choice based on my usage for almost 3 months now.

  Update after 3 months usage:-Sleep tracker has gone drunk from past few days. As you can see in the photo, I slept at 1:31 in night and woke up at 8:29 in morning (which are correct records, kudos for this) which means I slept for 7 hours but it's showing just 3:30 hrs. I mean it's simple maths. Lol.-After disabling all trackings, I'm getting more than 10 days of runtime out of this(screenshot attached). Which is sufficient I guess. With all trackings on, you can get 5-7 days.-It had many small bugs when I purchased it, like spelling errors, not been able to turn off heart tracking, but in the recent software update they fixed aome of them, though the accuracy is same as it was, 70-85%.So yeah they might also fix this sleep tracking bug in the next update.-Also, get a screenguard for this since the screen is not fully scrach-proof.--------------------------------It's a good watch but there are a lot of things that could be improved. I'm using this watch for 3 days and this is what I found-Pros--pomodoro timer is effective for any focus work. I use this while reading.-have a lot of exercise modes. Though I don't really use them.-alarm is effective. Always get me up.-can control songs and camera from this. Good feature.-magnetic charger is good and easy to connectCons--Unable to turn off full day heart rate tracking. It turns on automatically.-a lot of spelling mistakes.-steps counter is about 80-85% accurate.-i tested heart rate while on my exercise bike and it showed only 70-75% accuracy.-charged this watch to 95% on the first day and it have 50% battery on the 3rd day with full usage. So battery could be improved.-when I lift my hand to see the time, it takes about 1 sec for the watch to light up. This can be a little frustrating if you're in hurry.-i tested it's spO2 and stress tracker as well but not sure about their accuracy. Though I believe it'll also be about 70-85% accurate.-sleep tracker is also not intelligent. Like if u went to bed at 11 and used your phone or book for 1 hour and went to sleep at 12 then it'll count your sleep from 11 and not 12.Though I'm sure some of these cons will be improved by the next software update.So if you want to buy this watch then go for it if your main purpose isn't heart rate tracking or other tracking and just want a smartwatch for alarm, timer, and other little stuff.

   Lightweight and compact.Decent accuracy. I tested it for a short time and step tracking is very accurate. SpO2 is a bonus and it seem to be working well (I can't comment on the accuracy, but it does show different readings for different people and measures successfully only if you wear the watch tightly. So it's not a gimmick). I haven't used it long enough to comment on battery life but it should be good enough. Display is good and has decent resolution and good brightness. It could've had less bezels and more display, but it's not really a big deal at this price. Interface is fast enough. I didn't have any problem with it. Vibration is strong and you can change the intensity of vibration. The magnetic charger pin is convenient.It doesn't have always on display feature which is not really a big problem. But if you want that, you should buy another watch. Build quality is not great. It's decent, but nothing special. It feels a bit plasticky. Go for it at a price of 3500. But I don't think it's worth buying if price is more than that because it doesn't have GPS, AMOLED display, premium materials.Update : Battery life is 4-5 days with continuous heart rate monitoring(I set it to every 5 minutes) and sleep monitoring(It increases heart rate measurement frequency automatically when sleep is detected) on. So it's good enough. It'll last a week if you don't wear it during sleep for monitoring (I only did it to test it and it works well. But I don't think I'll wear it regularly during sleep).

  I faced some issues in it.1. Exercise icons, titles, data are not displaying. (see attached screenshots)2. Battery Draining too fast, In one single day it will consume 80%.3. Not properly synchronised with Google Fit app.4. also amazfit customer care services is worst i called many times but they disconnected many times, rudely talking

  Actually don't like to give a single star even. When I opened the box started to scan the QR code, it throws error saying code 2001not found. I have gone through some forums tried to fix the issue but found no luck. Such a waste of time and money. I placed this the very next minute to the sale started for this watch. Never get fooled by the hype shown in youtube. I doubt they are paid for the promotion.

  Basis the usage of 2 days:Step counter is not even close. While sitting in home for all day, it counts more than 700 steps steps. How can Outdoor step-counts can be believed?I am still trying the other parameters of this watch. Will update the review soon.

  I am using this for more than a day and very impressed with the watch, just wish it had alomed screen. It has all the latest features heart rate, spo2, sleep, stress, huge number of activities etc..Over realme it has gyroscope in addition to acceleration sensor. Better internal hardware than realme.You can store only 4 watches faces in watch and can replace easily from app.I have used badminton activity and it has alerts to configure if heart beat goes above 154. After the activity it shows all parameters with heart beat graph. Even we csn overlay it with sleep graph and can observe how we breath during the sleep.Battery life depends on how many features we use.So far all features are working, controlling audio, alerts sms, calls , from apps.Most of the settings can be configured from watch menus in addition to zepp app.You can see graphs/trend on the watch which is big plus. UI is very smooth and resposive, designed very well.  Dont forget to enable fetures from preferences like sleep, spo2, stress etc.. you can check breath quality also.Go for it simply before price hike...

I will update regarding that later.I was suspicious regarding screen quality and build quality but It was impressive. Best in price point and it is lot better than Noise colorfit pro 2 if anyone has doubts.You should go for it.ALSO ON AMAZFIT WEBSITE YOU CAN SEE IN DESCRIPTION THERE WILL BE AMAZFIT BIP U PRO WITH MIC. I HAVE ATTACHED IMAGE ALSO.If you found this Helpful, <U+0001F447> tap that helpful.

  It's been one month of usage of this device and it has surprised me with it's performance and also disappointed in certain aspects. The package was delivered in a day and was perfectly sealed. For this price, this is a sure shot but it may not attract some users. Here are some pros and cons:PROS:- The display is perfect and smooth to use.  Touch response is perfect in this price  range.- Display can be seen with lowest  brightness in sunlight which is impressive.- Cycle tracking is given in this watch.  PS: I don't know the functionality of  Cycle tracking. Hope it's giving the best  result. Also the watch is light weight, I  can't even feel the presence of it.- Watch faces provided are attractive.- Heart rate sensor and the steps count are  close to accuracy in this price range, we  can't expect apple watch accuracy in this,  so people complaining about the  accuracy need to take alternative steps.- Various exercise modes have been added  in this.- Sleep tracking is really good but not the  best.- Call hangup and alternate text sending  option has been added. Also our mobile  notifications can be enabled.- The water resistant feature is real and I  even tested it on the first day. So no need  to worry about it. But the straps are not  water resistant so make sure you wipe the  strap.Cons:- For this price range, always on feature has  not been added which is a major  drawback. So we have to either press the  button all the time or enable the lit upon  wrist lift option so that the screen will be  displayed Everytime we lift our wrist.- Fingerprint impressions are easily caused  on the screen. There's no anti fingerprint  coating on the screen.- At least one extra strap should have been  provided, and coming to the strap, the  strap is super light weight but the quality  is not up to mark. I sometimes feel  irritations if used for a longer time.- Them coming to the zepp app, which is  used to connect our mobile with the  watch, I have been facing issues with this  app. When I register it and use for the first  time and I sey everything, I find no issue.  But I am unable to open it afterwards. The  app gets crashed. I don't know whether I  am the only one having this issue. Them I  have to reinstall it again, and follow all  the procedures again just to check my  sleep pattern and I have been doing this  everyday since day 1 <U+0001F614><U+0001F614>- The stress and SPO2 sensors face issues  sometimes.- The screen easily welcomes scratches. So  it's better to buy a guard. I bought the  MGRJ guard and got it today. It's fitting  really well and I haven't faced any issues  in the touch sensibility.- Inbuild GPS could have been added in this  watch. We have to depend on our mobile  GPS.- And coming to the battery life part which  is important, they claim it can last upto  nine days. It's not true. Batter life depends  on the usage and the activities of the user.  To make the battery last for 9 days, one  has to inactive and make sure not to wear  the watch during night time and other  activities, then maybe the battery life will  be 9 days. For me in this 1 month, the  battery life has been for a maximum of 5  days and a minimum of 3 days. Don't ever  think about the 9 day claim of amazfit.So these are my opinions about this device. Hope someone finds it helpful.

  By now, I did not this like watch specially due to three reasons- first it's dial is small, not looking good on my wrist. Second it's strap is short, I tied in last hole. Third I am not finding any way to set my own picture as watch face as boasted in its description. Forth the most important one, it's battery draining too fast, I hardly connected this watch with mobile for two hours on first day after charging it 100% today on third day, it is 60% although I have booked this same watch for my father too which is not delivered yet but I am not happy with the watch delivered to me. I will wait for 3-4 more days and will go for replacement if don't satisfied

  Really good.Pros:Sleep tracking,BPM, and steps/activity is accurate SpO2 and stress is okay I guess. It's water proof the Zeep App is good. Vibration Alarm. Good display with good brightness. Comfortable and light weight. Very good for the introductory Price.Cons: Battery drains fast if BPM is tracked each minute and brightness all the way up will make battery last just one day.I can't connect to bt ear buds while using it.Overall a good product!

  I ordered it exactly at 12:00 on October 16 but was skeptical about how it would turn out since there were no reviews available but It's an amazing product & loaded with features, you just can't stop exploring!Feels very light on hand, display could have been a bit bigger but that's okay! Magnetic Charging works pretty well! The O2 is not accurate, BIP U shows 90% when the Oximeter shows 98/99. But it doesn't matter when there are other features! Camera and Music Control works like charm! Find my phone feature is an add on!Price Tag of INR 5,999 is not worth, just buy if you get it around INR 3,499 (Introductory Price).Only a Negative Point: It's Made in China! (I wasn't aware of this, otherwise wouldn't have ordered)Overall a fabulous product!

  It is an awesome looking watch and has some really impressive features and I would say that I was lucky enough to get the order through as mostly it was out of stock.Was really disappointed though as it was not able to detect any thing and always kept saying stay still and wear the watch properly. I have been using a smart band / watch for over 5 years now. I even tried to check the sleep and nap tracking but for both, it said that no sleep data detected. Hence, finally had to return the same the next day :(

  I've been using Amazefit product earlier as well and went for this latest Amazefit BIP U smatchwatch. It has all the feature that one needs in a watch along good option of health tracking options.You get call alerts but note that unlike other top end watches this has no option to answer calls directly. The screen much better than its predecessor.This watch does all the things that I need and is well within the budget.It uses about 10-12% of battery per day but this may change after couple of months.Download the Zepp app from the app store to pair this watch with your phone.Update after A month's use:The Display is really great and vivid, I love it with all the option of watch faces. The only thing that I hate is the watch disconnects frequently and there is no alert when this happens so you will have to make sure that you keep checking your phone if this is connected or not. Also the only way to get is connect again is by restarting the watch, which is not good. My phone is always on silent and I totally rely on the notification I get through the watch but this issue has let me down.

  So, I have been using this for 3 days now. Previously I had a Miband 4. Here's my review-Battery Life- 2/5.It lasts only about 2.5 days after full charging. My usage-All health settings(sleep+HR) at the maximum.3 hours of workout tracking everyday+music control. Lowest brightness setting. Mininmal notifications.Mi band 4 did all that and still lasted 12 days even after an year!Features- 5/5Sleep & HR tracking- 4/5Step counter accuracy-3.5/5OS/ UI - 5/5Build quality/sturdiness- 3.5/5Value for money - 5/5Only the battery is a big let down. Also spo2 seems to be a gimmick.I am not 'unhappy' after switching from MiBand 4.

  Display is good and looks ok. It's counting steps by own even you are walking or not. Even entry level watch or band majors steps properly. It measures steps even you traveling or driving, it's pathetic. Spo2 sensor most time shows measurements failed. Not expected this kind of watch from amazefit.

  Received this watch today, I am impressed with this watch. I want to use to entry-level smartwatch before moving to apple to high-end android watches. I will use this for 1 month and then again will review itPros:- Lightweight- Low price but not a cheap product- Display is great- Heartbeat and O2 measurement is great and working (not sure about accuracy)Cons:- Can store only 5 watch faces for new watch face have to delete existing stored one- Didn't find how to enable WhatsApp notification- Always-on display missing

Below are some pros and consPros:-It's very light weightTracking and app looks somewhat familiarAnd it's water proof.Cons:-Looks very small on Big wristAlways on display is missingBattery is somewhat 5-6 days if you used outdoor with hight brightness.GPS is missingAmazfit Bip U pro is coming with GPS and much more features so you can wait for this.

  Watch is nice, the interface is good but the battery is decent. I used it from the day it arrived with full charged and after 15hours it is 60% battery. Calculation of steps is fine and the watch faces are amazing brightness is good to see in sunlight. It calculates exact hours of sleep and the time you sleep and you wake up. Remember you didn't reliable on heart rate and stress monitor. This is not a medical device. The overall watch is value for money.

  Overall I ll give 4.5Anyone cannot compare it with the features of an apple watch..

Works fine with good light, preferably outside environmentPros:1.SPO2 is perfect 5/52.Heart rate monitoring better, but having some minor variation 4/53.Stress monitoring 4.5/54.Sleep monitoring 4.5/55.Bluetooth 5/56.PAI 5/57.Display 5/58. Activity tracker 5/59.Straps fit and quality 4/510.2.5D glass quality 4/5Cons:1.Battery could have been better 3/52.Blue tooth and PAI drain battery very quickly3. Straps could have been better4. Anti Finger print coat not that effective 2/5Overall it's worth for the every penny you spent, just go for it..This is just 3 days review, await for Long term review

  I ordered it on 18/10 and it was delivered to me on 25/10. Bought it on introductory price.Now, firstly there was only one colour available gor ordering that is black. I personally wanted to buy Sakura pink, <U+0001F929>nevertheless it is okay as it was on available on cheap rates.Secondly, packing was okay with no outside damages.I am not an expert but saw some flaws and some amazing stuffs about this watch while using it for 7 days.I paired it with an apple iPhone. Zepp app was up to date and compatible with IOS. I personally, liked the app.I was earlier using HONOR BAND 5( A beast band).Pros:1) Great price range i.e <U+20B9> 3500. 2) Very light plastic body, doesn’t feel like wearing even for 24 hrs but I found the strap of very cheap quality and basically feels like rubber. 3) SCREEN- it’s amazing. It was very clear even outside the sun. 4) some amazing features like SLEEP - i found it very accurate every time. 5) Another good feature was CYCLE TRACKING- good for women.<U+0001F618> 6)REMOTE PHOTOGRAPHY - it was easy to capture pictures from phone using this. 7) ALARM/WORLD CLOCK/POMODORO- Works fine. 8) Lots of exercising modes, good for fitness freaks.Cons:1)BUILT QUALITY- okay for 3500 but not for 6000. If you want to go for 6000 price range , go for other options. 2)BATTERY- Died on 5th day, even when not using PAI MODE. So it is a gimmick to say it lasts up to 9 days( maybe draining due powerful screen). 3) PEDOMETER- not accurate with fluctuations of 200-300 steps. 4) HEART RATE MONITOR- Doesn’t  gave proper readings every time. Out of 10, 5-6 are accurate.5) SpO2- it is great features taking present pandemic in mind. But it is not accurate, always gave below 95 and near 89-90 level. 6) It easily disconnects with phone so for me music controlling was a little tiring task from it. 7) may be it’s connectivity range is up-to 8 or less meters. 8) And I receive, all NOTIFICATIONS TWICE, I am still trying to figure it out why. 9) And it was very hard to get CALL NOTIFICATIONS . It took me 4 days to resolve it. 10) SCREEN- Susceptible to scratchesFinal verdict- It is a fitness band with more features and bigger screen.AND I tried to replace it but couldn’t connect with the Manufacturer even with repetitive tries.

  The overall rating is 2/5.If you are looking for sleep tracking, it's better to go with honor band 4. The sleep tracking in Amaze fit Bip U is miserable. Not at all accurate & not properly functioning.The workout mode is fine. The Battery life is a maximum of 4 days, most probably 3 days. The band will count steps if you are riding a bike.Battery life rating 1/5.Sleep tracking 2/5.Spo2-3/5.Heart rate monitoring 4/5.Communications (incoming call notification)-2.5/5.I won't recommend this to anyone. Only good as a watch with a big dial, cannot tell this as a health tracking device. While you are receiving a call you will get a notification, some times even after you answered the call, the watch will vibrate and show you the notification unless you turn it off manually.

  The highlight of the Bip U is the large 1.43-inch screen, 60+ sports mode, and 9 days of battery life.Talking about the look, material quality of the watch. it's very good, I'm writing review after using the watch for almost two daysFor more detailed look please checkout the images.. Strap quality of the watch is as expected. Product is exactly shown as in the images on Amazon. Ready to rock.Battery life of watch is also very good.Bluetooth connectivity works properly without any issues. Charger cable quality also good, charges quickly. Looks good on hands of men as well as women.. Till now not found any issues.overall good productGo for it!

  looks good on wrist. All features are good and almost accurate. only thing which i didn't like is the battery backup. I wear it for whole day. only remove it while taking bath. And with such rough use, it goes till 4th day. I have disabled many of its features like continuous heart rate tracking, PAI measurement, etc so the battery goes for longer period. But still it only works till 4th day after 100% charge. Needs improvement in terms of battery.

  Nice smartwatch got good features and lot of improvements from Amazfit bip watch. The accuracy is good with heartrate, sleep tracking SPO2 etc. There are lot of sports available with good measurments. But no GPS which I didn't see otherwise wouldn't have purchased. As i am a trqceller I can't keep my watch connected to mobile for gps tracking.Important note: The service of Amazfit is very bad and disappointing, they have only service center in ghaziabad and you have to send courier and pay 1589 <U+20B9> with return courier charges. Its very bad by amazfit the whole world buying products but service is 1* out of 5 <U+0001F44E><U+0001F3FC>

  I wouldn't suggest anyone to go for it,1. Wait for a couple of seconds after you lift your arm up to look at the time or would have to press the button2. Display is decent, battery usage after 2 days of usage is at 38%.Apart from this, most or all of the data captured is inaccurate. Quiet frankly it's very disappointing.What is the whole point of having 60+ exercises to measure, 60*wrong data.Heart rate, spo2, sleep tracking, seems to be more sort of a gimmick used to display values on screen.Maybe it's a \"price to pay\" for the \"price payed\" for the watch.Raised a return request, but they are sure that the replacement will work wonders.

  **REVIEW AFTER 1 WEEK USAGE**-----  The walk tracking is good and almost accurate -97%-----  The Sleep Tracking is a little incorrect. I woke up around 20 minutes later that the watch shows.-----  The Calorie & PAI tracking is great actually. It counts correctly as showed on the picture.-----  The Heart rate also shows almost accurate - 93%-----  PAI is the collest feature and uou can only gain that if you do a rigorous workout throughout the week. It is a measure of how you active you are along with the fitness you possess.**Please upvote if you like the review.

  Used it for 3 days. Here is my honest review of the Amazfit BipU watch.Pros:1. Looks Good2. Light Weight3. Lots of featuresCons:1. Inaccurate tracking: Heart Rate, SPO2, and even step tracking is inaccurate2. Battery doesn't last more than 3 days with continuous heart rate monitoring3. Looks like a toy watch, doesn't give a premium look4. Screen display area is lessIf you are simply looking for a smartwatch and do not really care about the accuracy of data. Go for it. However, if you are a health freak or need a watch for health tracking then you will be disappointed.

Phone GPS doesn't get sync and it always says no data found. Steps count is very poor and I did compare with my previous goqii watch. I don't recommend this watch even is 4k.

  Yes, this is a fitness tracker in disguise of a watch. However, it is excellent at this price point and is very hard to not recommend this.  Was earlier using the Amazfit Bip with GPS with the transreflective display, so coming onto this is absolutely night and day! The screen is bright and vibrant. You have plenty of watch faces to choose from. 60+ sports modes means that you can track almost any activity that you would do. Lastly, the battery life is not 9 days as advertised if you have all day heart and stress tracking on along with all notifications. This is getting in 4 days of battery life on full charge which is still amazing considering the Apple watch doesn’t last 2 days!Go for it! It’s a steal at Rs. 3499!

  Since this is a completely new product and there was not much reviews available.  So I took a chance and order it in the introductory sale @3.5k. To be honest I didn't have any plans to buy any smart watch, but thought it would be a great beginning before going into more expensive ones. So here are my thoughts after 2days of usage.Looks pretty cool.  Bright colorful display. Responsive touch, sleek design and very light weight. App is well designed and can take care of most of the settings. Heart rate monitoring,  SPO2 monitoring falters time to time but I won't be using for any medical records hence it's all fine. Customizable watch faces,  basic music controls,  remote camera shutter, app notifications are all that matters to me and it didn't disappoint. Cool product at the price <U+0001F60E>

  I'm writing this review after using for over a week. The battery life is pretty good. Charged it to 100% on the day I received it, keeping in mind that I have turned on notifications for quite alot of apps, it lasted a good 6days.The tracking is pretty accurate. Has a wide range of activities.Although when you go for a walk/run you'll have to carry your phone for GPS tracking to count the distance and speed.The product is light weight. The app is quite good. Was really happy with the range of setting/customisation for the screen.All in all, a good buy for a very reasonable price.

  I got the watch today, so these are my first impressions. The first thing that you see is the amazing screen and you realize you have paid just 3999 for it. Watch looks really good. I bought the black and sits very nicely in my hands. It weighs 31 gms, I almost don't feel it.The features all work and are accurate. The battery charges in 1-1.5 hrs when charged from my laptop. Obviously as you set up you see the battery going down and you do know that max of 9 days is actually what it will be. Frankly I'm okay with that. Ppl with Apple watch charge their watch almost everyday. The touch sensitivity is really pleasant. Easy to navigate around.Overall I would say it is a very good buy for someone who is looking for an activity tracker and want also a smart watch with it. If you were going to pay 2499 for MI Band 5, you might as well buy this for 3999 with good display, more features and a better watch. You get a smartwatch for that price - which I think is awesome considering it is the Amazfit Bip U. They have been in this industry for a while and have optimized their devices very well to become more accurate and better looking. Go ahead and buy. Don't think twice. I recommend.

  I bought this recently.  And after initial use I can say it is a good choice . I bought this as a fitness product.The SpO2 sensor gives quite accurate reading with little error . And heart rate sensor also gives accurate reading.. I confirmed both reading with Dr trust oximeter. Although for SpO2 reading it's takes longer time to detect.Watch faces which can be stored in watch itself are just four, rest you can only change with mobile only , which has quite a number of choices from its app.. You can also use your picture as watch dial.Battery backup seems good . After charging it fully two days back ,it still shows 55percent battery left that also when it's heart reading is on always on mode .Sleep quality thing is still showing no reading available.  It is supposed to be automatically checking the same.Touch control is good.Notifications for sms is good. And for mail and what's app is also not bad.As per the packing is concern it was excellent.So for such a price ,it's a very good smart watch.After two months of usage , the oximeter stopped working.  It doesn't even show in app . May be last update

  I had my doubts before buying it. But now I ll probably be using it everyday. The watch does everything you need it to do from notifications for your calls, messages, emails etc to tracking your essential fitness goals. Battery life and user interface looks good. The screen has a good resolution (cannot be compared to the apple watch). The screen has good visibility indoors and outdoors. In short it's a great watch for 3k. Hoping to get more software updates in the near future. Not sure if we can pair a Bluetooth ear pods along with the smart watch to your phone at the same time.

  Amazfit Bip U after 24H usagePros~Really Good Display. You can see clearly even under direct sunlight and under water~Comfort to wear all day. You won't feel there's something in hand~Light weight~Fitness measurements are  accurate~Sleep tracking is accurate~Strong vibration motor. You can set how strong you need~1H 20M to charge from 19% to 95%Cons- Battery is not great. May be they will fix it in future updates. Lost 24% in 19 hours heavy use. 19 hrs includes 1 firmware upgradation and 10 watch face synchronization.- with heavy use, battery may last for 4 days

  I was checking many smart watches below 5k before buying this smart watch. My main comparisons was on features, price and companion app. The finalists where amazfit bip U, Verge lite, noise NAV and Endure watches. Just before my buy boat storm was also launched. But when I compare the watch UI noise watches and boat was not upto the mark. The verge lite was totally good at the price range with good UI and inbuilt GPS but it was introduced an year ago, at the same time newly built Bip U has latest tecnology built with more wokout tracking and other features like SPO2 and stress monitoring. Also when we compare boat storm watch as its price is low many users where complaining about the companion app performance and also the previous tracker band of boat  has poor performance. So at last I came to this smart watch.Coming to the review of watch, it is well built with comfortable fit and attractive look. When i seen the images of watch, i feel like some what big for my hand, but it is really good. Feature like HR, sleep tracking, spo2, stress monitoring etc.. works well at this price range.HR works almost good and not showing readings if not in hand/body. Some times it doesnot detect the body presence and shows error for finding the HR but on the next try it will detect it properly if it is placed in hand.I am not clear on accuracy of spo2 and stress monitoring but feels its almost correct as I checked it with repeated use on same body and different persons. The detection time for both are high, we need to wait for more than 15 second to get the reading.The workout modes was the main attraction of bip U with good UI than previous bip watches. On outdoor run it trackrs location using phone and can display the gps map/path in watch itself after the run. The step counter is also good but not fully upto the mark. On riding in vehicle it some times showed step counts but not bad as mi band.Call and app notifiations works nicely in nearly realtime. No complaints on that. Cherging time is almost 1hour 30 minutes and battery backup is as expected. Many were complaining about the backup but for a normal user I think we get the 9 days. After the first update I get 11 days(+9% battery) backup with continous HR on with 30 minutes interval. If you do only limited workouts(less than an hour per day) I think the battery backup is OK.The companion app(ZEPP) is similar to the previous mi fit app, has good user friendly UI. Thw watch faces stored in watches is limited to 4 with only 2 of them can be managed using the app. Currently it has 47 watch faces and i think they are adding more faces. Recently they have added 2 faces. Watch firmwareupgrades are also provided in intervals for these changes(Got 2 upgrades till today). When talking about quality of faces, only some of them feels good for me. Its a personal opinion.

  I added a pic along with Apple watch SE just for size comparison purpose.Pros:Very light weight.No it's not tiny its just ok for an average size wrist.Most importantly the measurements taken by the watch are fairly accurate. The errors are minimal and I will definitely trust these steps heart rate and even spo2 measurement are fairly accurate. I got 95 on the watch as compared to 98 on my spo2 device and next time I got 98 in both.The interface on the watch is easy to swipe and reach any mode.Raise to wake works 99/100.Sunlight legibility is good and no issues.Battery life is OK like discharging in 3-4 days or so.if you configure heart rate for 30 mins which is Ok for a healthy person and take SPO2 2-3 times a day and then go with standard configuration.Limited but easy customisation.Notifications are prompt and fairly quick.Cons:Strap is very very cheap and flimsy. Please change should you find another one.Watch faces are not elegant unlike the ones from Fitbit and apple.Notifications are prompt but sometimes are hit or miss. You may miss them or some sms may not come at all. Calls are promptly.displayed. I am not sure how long term performance will be.You cannot connect this with 2 phones simultaneously and if you change the process in my case required a reset.

  Everything about this fitness tracker is good, except the battery backup. On a normal usage with notifications on for some 3-4 basic apps, the battery won't last for more than 3.5 days. There is no way the battery would last for a week as claimed by the company.Coming to the parameters it captures, it seems to do a decent job with step count and distance accurate ranging above 85% (tested with treadmill walk/run). Heart rate is also 75-80% accurate.Spo2 meter works some time and at other times it doesn't get any reading.Overall, it's a decent tracker, won't call it great.

  Big screen, screen resolution is very high , UI slow while updating any of watch face from app, when you wear this watch 5min only they gave you foot print on the wrist of hand, this is very horrible, I am usi g this watch from last 2 days I feel this watch is not for long time using if you are workaholic so this gave you negative impact...Heart rate okay, spo2 is also okay, but we want something that gave us truly smartness in this but this is missing from amzfit.

  I bought this watch on 16th October and without any doubt i can say that this watch is THE BEST. From looks to weight distribution to function accuracy, it has done its best.The makers have not forgotten about the metrics while keeping the style in mind. As far as tracking goes the watch does a great job at it.

  Why can’t I swim or shower with Amazfit Bip?Amazfit Bip can withstand a maximum depth of 1.5 meter water for up to 30 minutes. The resistance testing is performed in fresh water, normal temperature and under static condition. Submerging your device beyond the maximum depth or beyond the maximum time frame could potentially harm the device and cause hardware issues.Amazfit Bip shouldn’t be used when you are swimming, taking a shower/bath, having a spa or in the sauna/steam room.When you move your arm to begin swimming, water pressure can change quickly. It would be much higher than the static pressure at the depth of 1.5 meters and it’s possible water could force its way into the device.When you are taking a shower/bath, rapid changes in temperature may cause expansion and contraction damaging the watch and its water-resistance rating. Shampoo, soaps and other liquids are highly corrosive to the wristband and the casing of the watch.

  PROS -Display is it's major pro! It's colours are very bright and crisp. We can even view emoticons (smilies) in the watch notifications.The Interface/UI of the watch is smooth and eye catching.There is an option to silent or reject the call and we can also send a customized message from the watch itself if we want to reject the call.We can even customise the vibration of the watch.We can't see any smudges (fingerprints) on the screen while the watch display is on whereas we can see some smudges when the display is off but only if your fingers are a bit sweaty.Heart rate monitoring, Stress level, Spo2 and Sleep monitoring are also quite accurate. (90%)Music and camera control on our watch.The watch is very light weight.CONS -Step tracker is not that accurate. Needs improvement.Battery is draining a little fast. It will most probably last for a week. (Active heart rate monitoring + Sleep monitoring + Stress monitoring + WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat notifications on)Hope it will be improved via updates.(Haven't checked any workout mode yet!)Final review - Go for it! It's amazing!

  You really can't go wrong with a Amazfit product. The first thing I did was to check step accuracy by wearing a Honor band and Garmin Forerunner and going for 6 km walk. Found the Bip U very accurate. Did the same for checking the Sleep parameters and Bip U was again found equally accurate. For a watch that costs less than 8 times the Garmin, this is commendable. The Zepp app is just about Ok. No ability to start workouts from the App and data sharing with friends does not work. But PAI is just awesome. Keeps you motivated.

Spo2, Heart rate monitors are quite accurate (However, it should only he used for reference and should not be used for medical purpose as advised by them). Battery life is decent. Strap quality is good. Display is decent. Zepp phone app (Amazfit app) is amazing and has many features. Overall, at this price range it is a feature packed watch and one can go for it.

  I like it's design. #accuracy It's accuracy is great but they very hard to measure. Like if u have to measure #heartrate or #sp02 u will have to be still your hand should necessarily be resting on a table and facing upwards and is in between your measuring your hand moves even a little, the measurement will be failed and you're will have to restart the measurement again. Another thing that i disliked is that u can't store more that four faces on the watch in which two are inbuilt which can't be replaced and two can be replaced. The only one button that is provided only works if u press it it does not have any function if u rotate it. The button inly works on pressing not on scrolling. I would suggest if anyone is going to buy it please give some more time and save some more money and buy a little more expensive watch that could stand up on ur expectations. There are also many functions given in the #mobileapp like body mass, muscle mass and much more things but they too do not work, it shows there is no data for today.

  In this price segment it is the best watch!! Just go for it!!!Display is awesome, battery will last for 4-5 days with continuous heart rate monitoring, stress and sleep tracking and 1-2 times of SPO2 monitoring.Even if the always on display is not there it does not matter as when our hands are down we won't be seeing the watch, to check the time we will always lift the wrist and the lift wrist action is very responsive.Looks good on every hand including kid.Best watch so far!!!!

  The watch is great in terms of features and everything But the battery backup is really bad. I tend to do workout twice a day with walking and weight lifting and to keep a track on it, I usually switch on the activities. With all these turned on, I get approximately 3-4 days of battery backup which is really very less. So if battery backup is not a deal breaker for you, then it's good to go.

  Like the size, fit, build quality, battery usage. But when it comes to working its absolute displeasure of having paid and not getting any results. Pedometer is cent percent inaccurate, always step counts are wrong, not even a single time oxygen levels have come fine, if you sync with Google fit, the Google fit numbers also goes wrong which otherwise are near accurate. Heart rates are probably only thing that's closer to accuracy. It cannot count floors climbed though this was not a feature published. I wear it as I have paid and not that it's helping me in any manner, I'm relying on other health apps on my phone rather the watch and Zepp app. Zepp app cannot synch up offline steps without watch too. It's just a passive app that will show up readings of watch or help change settings. Do not go for this rather there are other Amazfit watches that I have heard are good like GTS. Lastly it's bad for ever so that one is consistent atleast.

  Amazfit bip u.. watch is not upto mark. The watch build quality is not good and activities trcaking also not accurate. Even when you are in driving also steps will be counted and that also not accurate. There is no pair and unpair option in this watch without reset option which is really disappointed. Battery life given as 9 days but is has given only 1 full day . Requed for replacement since there is no return policy for this watch. Only good thing in this watch is display is ok and performance is somewhat better .

  Step count is a big joke. Even if you shake or wave your hand then also steps will be counted. Sleep tracking is also not perfect.Most of the times SPO2 measurement fails. You have to try multiple times. Doesn't e meet the purpose and waste of money. Not worth at all and I don't recommend this watch.

  My review after one and a half month usage. Delivered on Dec 2. Very disappointed. 9days battery life is a surety only if you are not wearing the watch. It will not last for 4 full days when you are moderately active( you are buying a fitness watch to use it). My watch suddenly went off, and the warranty claim process is one hell of an issue in this product. No clarity from them about authourised service centers. Online warranty registration is hectic. Buy a better watch.

  It's battery is pathatic, after charging it 100% I kept full brightness and all other aspects (ativity tracker, heart rate monitor, etc) in on mode, battery lasted for 6 hours, and after that, again I charged it 100% and set my watch on normal screen with reduced brightness and all type of other options in off mode, battery lasted for 15 hours. I did like this for continuous 3 days in a row. It's worst experience anyways. Go for other good brands available In market. Don't believe 9 days battery frod by amazfit.

   In short, All is a great except1. For some reason there were rashes under the area where I use to wear the watch band. (I had to face some skin issues with this one)2. Only 2 watchfaces can be changed via app and other 2 can not be changed in any manner.3. Sometimes only the phone No. comes insted of the name of the person calling even after the No. Is saved in the phone.6. It's Controled by a Chinese companyz which has it's own set of problems. I just wish it was a Non Chinese company which was not made in China. But that ain't the case.Rest all is great. Battery life for a full week if using all the features.Overall I am satisfied with the product.

  Pros:1. Charging is fast.2. Touch and screen resolution is good with brightness control.3. Mobile App is easy, paring with mobile is easy.4. Several functions as described in the product description.5. Watch UI is good and functions are easy.6. Strap quality is good and replaceable too.7. Battery life is good.8. Upadates it's software automatically when connected with mobile app.Cons:1. Assessories like the magnetic charger or strap is not available for purchase seperately yet. If the charger gets impaired or the strap is broken then it would be difficult to find a new one and replace them.2. Requires your mobile bluetooth always ON to keep connected the watch. However, U can turn off mobile bluetooth at times, like when you're not carrying your mobile or not checking the watch app for activity data and once you turn the mobile bluetooth ON, the watch activity data will sync with your mobile app. But, when mobile bluetooth is OFF, the mobile app notifications will not appear in the watch.

  Been using this for approx 10 days now.Pros:Immaculate specs for the price point. Found sleep tracker to be very accurate. Can detect naps which are greater than 20 minsGood display qualityStress, Spo2, heart rate seems fineCons1.The battery life is a big setback. Nothing even close to 9 days as claimed. At max 5 days with moat of the function disabled.4 days is actual battery life. A big thumbs down there2. Strap quality is not upto mark. Feels itchy after 1 day useCan't really complain at the price point for which watch is selling. If you are willing to spend 2.5k on fitness band, spend a thousand a more and get a amazefit smartwatch instead

  The battery sucks if you connect with mobile all day long, else lasts for 4-5 days when fully charged.The accuracy of sensors is very bad except for steps counters.Stress measurement fails giving you more stress.It requires very steady hand with no disturbances of any kind for just descent results; As if we will keep wrist steady all day and do no work at all.Same goes for sleep monitoring as well.These smart watches are just like toys and are of no actual use (As stated not for medical use coz not accurate mostly).Also app has same icons at multiple places and no proper/simple segregation or structure.In short, if you rich and want to spent on costly toys, buy itPs: Rather go for bands which are almost same at half cost

  The watch is good. Great display, looks nice on the wrist. Lasts for around 4-5 days with a full charge.But DON'T BUY if your primary purpose is walking/running.The watch is great, but the companion app - \"Zepp\" - is a total waste. The location accuracy of the app is very bad. I tried several times, it shows 24km when I walked only for 6km. It blindly multiplies the current speed with the total time to calculate the total distance. Also, the GPS location jumps kilometers randomly in the Zepp app which is totally inaccurate. I reported this several times, but no response so far. This inaccurate app makes the entire watch totally useless for fitness tracking.Please look at the reviews for the Zepp app on Google Play before buying.So if you are planning to buy as a \"fitness tracker\" to walk/run on outdoors, keep away from Amazfit models because of the extremely poor Zepp app. I am not sure about the results in GPS enabled models.

  Hi Everyone!!Watch is good in terms of feel.Will give detailed review after few days.Quick View -1. Battery dropped 2 % in 10 Mins2. 1.5 Hours of upgrade needed for first Time3. If you want to change watch face it will take 10 mins for each to synchronize.4.  Screen size is a little smaller than expected.5. Screen quality is good in room and in sunlight.

  Product Built & Design is Overall good, Only problem with its accuracy even step count is not accurate, temperature display error, spO2 is more or less good , Heart rate measurement is ok. you cant rely on  this as its not accurate as mentioned in product description & customers review. Battery is good to go for almost 6 days & depends how u use,Display is awesome at this price range. it really needs software improvement & please noted down its has only one service center located in Ghaziabad and their customer care really sucks.

  Great product value for money Screen is greatStep tracking and heart rate is at par with samsung active 2Spo2 sensor is 5% less than reading on samsung s9 or any medical device so take it accordingly plus is very slow.Features and sync of data with app and google fit is good.Battery life is max4. 5 to  5 days with heart rate set to every 10 mins and 2 times spo2 reading a dayWatch faces r limited but still good collection lots of options to chose from.No always on display but lift ur wrist light up screen which results in false waking up tje screen a lot hence reducing app.Dont think great buy at this price.

  Feature packed smart watch for this price.A good display and features(HR, sp02, sleep tracking, notifications)Battery lasts for 3-4days with all continuous HR monitoring which is slightly lesser than what they promised initially.Accidentally ordered 2 and there was no option to return 1. Gifted to someone and they are also liking.*strap is not very good, its causing rashes if wearing at 1 arm.

  I am using this watch for over 1 week now and the watch is really doing a decent job!! and in daily usage I feel like the watch is really good for your fitness apart from battery because the battery can last give you upto maximum 4 to 5 days not more than that because I only charge the watch for over 2 times in this week but I should say that this watch is seriously very very accurate plus it also look so stunning on hand!!<U+0001F60B>  You should go for this watch under 4k!!

  Pros:1- display quality is brilliant in all lights2- sleep tracking is excellently accurate3- heart rate tracking and all other tracking is fairly accurate with stress tracking too. No problem in that.4- watch faces are good too..have variety of options.5- very light weight.so wearing while sleeping is comfortable.Cons:1- display size is small due to huge notch where brand name is printed so that will be the biggest con of this watch.2- sometimes call notification is delayed by approx 3-4 seconds. Not consistent there. Rest is fine..i would suggest to go for the features it provides like 24 hr heart rate and fairly  good workout and sleep tracking. Rest for the display it will be a problem due to the size to be fair. I returned the watch for the same reason.

  Reviewing after 1 month of usage of this smart watch. Mostly I use Steps count and sleep tracking and both are working good and accurate. SPO2, stress test, breathing exercise are excellent options provided in this smartwatch. Sedimentary reminder comes though you got up from the seat, I'm not sure of this is the way it works. Battery is coming for 6-7 days with continuous use, with 30 min to 1 hour bluetoth on daily and No other continous tracking.Overall I am happy the watch.

  I have used colorfit pro 3 for several days but got disappointed with overall performance and even with its mobile app appreance, it was too basic and can be seen in lowerend band as well. (Issues faced: HR not accurate, watch face are very basic, connectivity issue, sleep tracker inaccurate).Now I have been using amazefit bip u since 3 days. And I am really happy with the performance and the features they are offering at this price. At 4k price it is really worthy.

  The performance of d watch is good, but d dial is very smallSports modes are working fineSleep tracking is waste, Sp02 shows that I am always in danger..coz it shows my O2 level at 83% where as my Pulse oximeter show 98%Worst part is d strap, very cheap strap for a 4k smart watchThe manual has not good content, they have made it fat by adding 25000 languages which has no significance to meThey have not supplied a small micro fiber cloth also to clean d watch..I mean that's a shame

  Fairly satisfied with the watch.Looks very similar to Apple Watch. Battery life seems to be decent with 7-8 days in normal usage. Calls can be either rejected or made silent with the watch. It has multiple sports modes which can be used to track different workout regimes, however the accuracy may be a concern. There is also SpO2 sensor, but it cannot be used as a substitute for Pulse Oximeters. Vibration motor is strong enough to wake you up from sleep (has 3 levels of vibrations). Supports multiple and custom watch faces from the Zepp App. However, the one feature which is missing is Always On Display. There is Lift up display in place of AOD.Overall a feature rich smartwatch for 3499/-.

  After using this for 6+ months.For the price it is really a great option. You get almost everything in terms of specs except GPS, speaker and mic.Con-There are a lot of bugs which can be fixed by software updates but they don't do it even if you report it.Ex- if you are on a call (call1), and call2 comes in waiting, the watch will show call2 notification but when you press the end(red) button on the watch it will end call1, that's even funny that the developer didn't notice this.So in short it's a good watch in terms of specs but very buggy in terms of software but yes the software is smooth.Battery life- 5 days (average)Durability- 4/5Comfort - 5/5

  I have used this watch for 2 days extensively and lets begin with some good points. I have been using amazefit stratos for a while and then shifted to this one.1. Good display considering the price2. 60 plus workout modes available3. Spo2 tracking4. Stress tracking5. Sleep tracking6. Battery lasts for 4 days even with all th notifications on, continuous heartrate tracking, stress tracking7. Pai calculation for fitness8. 100 plus watch faces (i only use one though)Cons9. Auto tracking of activitiesCons1. Charging is slow. It took around 2.5hrs to charge fully.2. Doesn't have inbuilt gps3. Doesn't have vo2 max tracking4. Doesn't have training effect trackingConsidering the price point, the negatives can be overseen.5. Spo2 tracking is a bit slow where you have to keep your hand steady.6. Screen is not scratch proof. Screen got a small scratch while i was doing some work.7. No always on display. I wished it had one.I would certainly recommend this watch to anyone who is looking for a fitness tracker along with a smartwatch.

  If you got this for <U+20B9>3499 during the sale, then you're fine. This watch is not worth more than that. The original pricing which was about 5.5k is a joke.You can expect the battery life to be 4-5 days on average with all the excercise tracking.The values are fairly accurate when the watch is worn tightly on the wrist but here comes the surprise, the watch strap is really uncomfortable! It leaves marks on your wrist as if you've worn a tight rubber band all day long and this isn't just on the lowest comfortable adjustment of the strap. I thought I'll get adjusted to it after a couple of days but that clearly isn't the case.Now the only solution is to buy a seperate pair of straps that are comfortable.

  Dial is very small, display is bright, strap quality is ok, Battery life is average, step count is not accurate when your driving car i observed step count increase upto 200. SPO2 takes lot of time to measure, accuracy is +- 3%Price is high since it doesn't have GPSDisplay always ON option not availableOver all its an average smart watch with good display

  Product isn't smart and you can use just like a normal digital watch as the app is pathetic and gets disconnected again and again and to keep watch active and in sync you have to again and reconnect which is completely waste and pathetic activityYou will not receive alerts even when connected as the notification settings gets restored automatically again and again and you have to allow the app to be synced again and againVery poor performance and pathetic product and on top Amazon isn't helping with refundI will be escalating the matter to seniors and get the value refunded as no one will pay the price to use a digital watch

  Overall watch is good. The main drawback is SpO2 is not reliable. It gives variable reading. So SpO2 sensor is not useful in this watch.Pros:1. Have option to quick reply with message when a call rings. This feature is very useful while driving.2. Good build quality3. Looks good.4. Display is colorful and good and visible in sunlight.5. Steps count are accurate.6. Distance is accurately tracked using phone's GPS.7. Much things can be done using watch without opening the app.Cons:1. Battery lasts for 3 days on heavy usage and 5 days on normal usage. It consume 5 % battery in a day and around 10% in night if active sleep monitor with breadth quality is on.2. SpO2 sensor is not reliable.3.  Zepp is not good as mi fit app.

  Do not buy this product if you care about your skin. I don’t wear this anymore because it gives me rashes. Whats the point of a smart watch/tracker if you cant wear it for extended periods of time. You may end up spending more on your skin problems than this watch costs.Apart from that, its charging time is very slow and accuracy of spo2 and stress/heart rate is bad

  Activated the excercise reminder. Even if I am standing for the last 2 minutes, watch will remind me to standup. Amazfit could have launched the GPS version in India, but seems like Amazfit takes Indian customers for granted. All better versions with additional features are launched in China.

  I bought this watch for tracking steps and workout activities. The watch is amazing at this price point, but the inaccurate step tracker was a bummer :(The main problem arises when the watch counts over 500-600 steps each time you travel in a vehicle. The steps are synced in myfitnesspal and google fit leading to weird calorie counts.

  Got it in first sale in just 3498/- and I must say this watch can easily beat any other brand watches in 10k segment.Using this product from last 6 days; Build and strap is good quality is good enough although they made from plastic but do not feel cheaper. Display is protected with gorilla glass and has 4 brightness mode and is bright enough to read the texts even in sunlight, usually I set it in 1 point only. Sensors just works like charm and this watch is waterproof till 50 meters<U+0001F44D>.Spo2 sensor, stress tracker, sleep tracker works pretty well and it has 60 sports mode to track your all activities.I have enabled all the sensors so i am getting almost 6 days of battery life.Overall, a best option to buy.

  This is my 1st smartwatch . I trust that I haven't made any mistake with this choice as the purchase is quite satisfactory indeed. An introductory price of Rs 3500 makes this smartwatch one of the best value for money smartwatchs at present available in the market. I am getting 5 days of battery life with continuous use. Watch faces are nice but I feel few more if added would be really great for the users. Accuracy is 90 to 95% correct. Sensors and their performances and accuracy are prime important while choosing a smartwatch. Otherwise it doesn't make any sense to buy a smartwatch just to see time. I am satisfied with the product's fit and finish , accuracy , its lightweight and look quite like an apple watch which is good for some people. The best part of this Bip U is absolutely fantastic accuracy level of pedometer, spo2, heart rate monitor which make it a special buy. Best buy and value for money in my opinion. Amazfit is a trusted brand in smartwatch arena.

  Wow ! This is been one of my best purchases... I am extensively using this watch and am quite happy and satisfied with its performance and battery back up. This helps me track my stress, heart rate, sleeping hours, mensuration tracking, and lit many things more.  I have a complete review done on my yt channel - GlamNMe ( picture of thunmnail added) do check out!!! It's worth buying....

  It's been a week I have been using amazfit bip U and I am happy with the decision to buy this watch. Best part about the watch is that it feels too light on wrist and is comfortable. Steps count, sleep tracker, heart rate tracker and Spo2 tracking has been accurate and I am impressed with the software and the zepp app as well. It is the best option for the price and does justice to what it is meant for. I would definitely recommend people to buy this watch with out any second thought. I rated 4 star for this watch as I felt the build quality could have been better. But good trade off for the price. Thumbs up

  All ok I think blood oxygen tracking is issue not work properly, but some time's work it goes down or up in few minutes check, can't trust Accuracy. Not sure of sports mode not use much. Continuous heat rate on 30min and no other notification battery goes only for 5 and half day I keep other notification and sleep monitoring, tress monitoring on then battery will dies in 3 to 4 day's.Attract scratches not scratch resistance. Not for Ruff use.I think it's better to go for BOAT Smart watch.

  Battery : I consume it for maximum 5 days with every 30 minutes heart beats sense.Good and if you not connect it always with your phone then more battery remains.Touch: Very Good,Quick,Responsive.UI: Amazing but some times i feel its lag when i drag to see notifications.Accuracy: I am completely satisfied with its sleep monitor,steps count,heart rate.But in case of SpO2 it will disappoint u.OverAll 4 stars for Best Budget Fitness Watch and a comprehensive App, which is easy to use.1 star deducted because i feel its screen size should be maximum and could be more bigger (full screen) if the badging remove from top and sometimes Stress,SpO2 fails to function.Moral: I'm happy with the watch and its far better then my previous Mi Bands.Thanks...

  At Rs.3500,a great smart watch loaded with a lot of functions. Works almost for 5 Days on one single Charging(100% Battery to 8% Battery).Pls note that inbuilt GPS is not there but Connected Mobile's GPS is helpful here.The only thing which is not working is auto reply after disconnecting calls.Display is Great,even in day light(Outdoor).

  Perfect choice for them who are looking for budget activity tracking watch (Not a complete Smartwatch) for regular use.Impressed with on time delivery. The packaging was neat and easy to unbox. Got update as soon as I did the initial setup of watch. After using almost 2 weeks, the Heart Rate, SPO2, Stress readings are very much satisfactory. However, surprised with the accuracy of sleep tracker. It's amazing. The sleeping time is recorded so accurately.Screen size is sufficient, graphics are awesome. It's not AMOLED, but still gives best brightness in outdoor specially during high sun light. Screen response is good. Strap is comfortable.Notifications (call, SMS) are bit delayed compared to Honor Band 5. But as I said in the beginning, it's not Complete Smartwatch. With the price tag, it's giving more than you look for.So guyz, instead of wasting 3K more for Amazfit GTS2 mini, I would suggest to go for BIP U which is best in all functionalities and very very good for regular use.Happy Shopping !

  It's best smart watch under 5k. But there are problems. The twist to wake doesn't work every time. The touch is not good. And the overall watch looks and feels pretty cheap like the lcd watches u get on roadside for 200rs. I wonder if it's really coated with anti fingerprint material as they claim coz i can see my fingerprints. This creates a doubt in my mind if it's really waterproof as they claim

  It's decent for a smartwatch. It looks decent, has some decent watch faces but that's about it.App is unintuitive. Features and settings on mobile app are spread across various menus, but it's only an issue while settings up.Sensors are about average but do not buy it for SPo2 sensor. it does not work well. It returns a failed message on most ocassions. When it does manage to read, it takes significantly long time to do so and readings vary widely. I have got readings ranging from 90-98 during consecutive reads.You cannot answer calls using the watch either but everything else works about ok.

  If you are looking for a square dial watch under 4k.. this is the best choice... Tft display which is too good even on outdoors... Their unlimited watch faces add a shine to it... It is light weight which makes it easier to wear whole day... Only drawback is lack of Gps but at this price point , it can't be expected... Rest everything , wonderful.

  After 20 days of usage,1) sleeptracking is working fine2) HR monitoring is accurate (close to the BP monitor)3) O2 and Stress montitor is also good.4) Awesome watchfaces.5) Can wear this watch 24 *7 as it is durable, water resistant, lite weight6) I don't prefer GPS on watches as I always carry phone with me. I am satisfied7) Activity goals works fine as expected8) battery is not like what they advertise. But the battery can withstand up to 3 days if you are using a custom watch face or upto 5 days if you are using a default watch face

  Great product, initially I was sceptical about the product but after watching many videos on youtube, then I decided to buy and friends, now I don't regret on my decision. I am fitness freak, so performance was the primary parameter for me, it really stand out well, read automatically my running timing as well, which is acurate, look is awesome, feels like a premium one, display is great, performance is outstanding. Love using this. Go for it guy.

  This being my first fitness band smart watch, I'm totally in love with it. The different work out modes like dance, rope skipping, core fitness, outdoor walking/ running etc are easy to access and accurate. It motivates me to do better day after day. The sleep tracker is also amazingly accurate. Battery lasts for about 3-4 days if worn for 24 hours. Overall a wonderful product for the price range. Just go for it.

  When we place an order for any product online and even after watching a million unboxing videos & reviews - we are always curious about \"what is inside the box\". I thought my sharing the pictures, everyone gets an idea of the same.My experience in the first 48 hours has been a mixed bag but primarily positive. The configuration is not that easy as some Youtube reviewers make it to be. Some of the features are buried deep in the UI and the UI is very easy to understand & navigate so finding these features is easy.Coming to accuracy, it is almost 90-95% accurate. SPO2 reading might not work on every execution but when it works it is also 90-95% accurate. The sports modes are useful and I compared the treadmill mode with the actual reading on my treadmill and they were almost the same.In short, I am liking it for the price point and if you look at some of the features in the app - you will notice that some are disabled which for me is a hope that a lot of features can be included or activated using OTA updates.Looking forward to the experience and at least it is a good change from all the heavy smartwatches I am using now.

  Excellent watch that offers more than it should at 3.5k! Really amazing with so many features. The few features that are missing in this watch are (i) You can't put your mobile to silent mode directly from watch. However you can silent incoming calls; (ii) There is no compass (magnetic sensor).Overall, it's more that worth for its price!

  Bought for around 4k & Below are my Initial observations:-1.Delivery: As usual, Amazon delivery is express as delived to me in Dun within 36 hrs. Definitely 5 Star.2. Package: Great packing & little care from my side too(Covid precautions). Good.3. Watch: First look & feel is good. Just, screen is bit smaller than the overall watch size(can be compromised at this price.4. Features: Synced up with App without any trouble. All features are working fineUnits are normal for me. (Need to observe for another week for better output).I Like: Multiple faces out of which 4 are great which I saved on the watch & can be changed with a click.Planning to buy each one in the family now :P.Overall a Satisfied customer for now.

  Battery improved after month usage. Updating rating to 4 starsOne star taken as offline watchfaces like other bip watchesThis is by far the most beautiful screen in a smartwatch below 5k.Bought it over mi band 5After 5 days usage - Battery life is just 3 days instead of claimed 9 days. Taking away 2 stars.

  Review comments are based on my usage for past 1 month :Pros : good watch faces, pretty good interface and integration with mobile app, easy to use, good analytics in mobile app,Light weight and sleek, good accuracy for BPM and exercise, PAI is also good as it pushes you to attain 100 for a week.CONS: sleep tracking was good for 1st 2 weeks and then suddenly started showing very less values in terms of hours (may have to do with sensor quality), Don't use SPO2 in this device as its highly inaccurate and doesn't work most of the time, battery is poor as I tried different options to check how long does battery last, if you are using sleep monitoring it will just last for 2 days.So in a nutshell I will say it actually qualifies for a fitness watch and not much in other categories..

   Got this watch today. Looks pretty decent.Good for ladies to keep track of their cycle, very thoughtful of the makers for introducing this particular feature. It has the most no of Activity modes. 60 to be precise, it's going to be a Giant Killer among GOQI. Noise. Mi revolve and others, other than the build quality, or can stand upto an apple watch. Spo2 and pai features are rarely to be used. It dsnt have in-built GPS which is kinda OK. You anyways carry your phone. Do compare it with Honor GTS the one which is being sold at arund 6k and then decide. Bip U has lots and lots of watch faces to choose from. Its v light in weight. Vulnerable to scratches. Plastic/polycarbonate is case is the only negative so far.

  1. Very Bad battery - lasts upto 24 hours and not above it.2. Claiming warranty is lengthy and not a surety. Send email via feedback page in app. I did it 4 days ago and haven’t received a response till now.3. I like the options and details it shows.4. Would love to learn way to put a picture as background.

  Pros:1.) The watch is sleek, lightweight and good looking.2.) takes less time to charge, charging dock is easy to connect.3.) Heart Rate sensor is pretty accurate, almost equivalent to professional one.Cons:1.) Spo2 sensor is a hoax in this one. Its more of hit and trial process and 90 % of time either gives you faulty reading or filed measurement status.2.)Its poorest aspect is that during running, even watch is connected to phone every time via bluetooth, it always fail to sync with GPS. Wither you have \"No GPS\" or faulty/misleading data. My old Mi3 band still performs better than this one.3.) Battery life is not so great, as advertised.Summary: Needs lot of improvements.

  It has good amount of features for the price.I love the display and battery performance.You can set your own custom watch face.No matter the size of notification you can always read it properly also it has support for google emojis.You get spO2 sensor and sleep tracking which is good near to perfect but sometimes it just cant read if you dont wear watch tight and at right spot so watch wearing style plays important role.You have different app from other bip options so you dont get all those watchfaces but if you are jugadu enough you can use them as well.Overall happy user from past 3 months no problems whatsoever. Also you keep getting software updates on app. GO FOR IT!

  I have been using since last few months, I found it ok till last few weeks where I am not getting the GPS tracking accurately. It doesn't show the entire route and hence distance is not accurate. This leads to complete miscalculation of my workout. The algorithm used are good the output is simple and wasy for even a layman but u need to feed in lots of data to get full use of all the outputs. I am currently not using it to full limits as I need to constantly in put lots of data hence if u also don't want to do that then go for some other simpler ones. This is more for those hard-core workout type people.

  I mainly use for sleep tracking, walk tracking and free style exercise.  It gives reasonably accurate readings.  I also check heart beat, SPO2 etc.  I am not sure how accurate they are.  But generally the watch is worth buying for the price.  It gives more accurate readings when compared to watches of this price of different brand.  Battery comes for 1 week without continuous heart beat monitoring

  The strap quality is below par as it has started to wear-off within a month already. The steps and GPS accuracy is not up to the mark as it shows different reading while walking on the same course. The sleep data is detailed but not sure about the accuracy. Having said that, it is a good smart watch but it is a bit over-priced.

  Stop stop <U+0001F62C>First of all don't be too confused I did a research on fitness tracking watch.If you love accuracy don't go for anything other than apple or fitbit(high end model)Other than accuracy everything was fine in this .app seems to be nice after one week of use.For low budget guys like me I'll suggest this one .The problem I noticed is accuracy when I compared spo2 with oxymeter ( that to 2 to 3% variation).So over all review is good.

  After a week use, I would recommend you to buy this product if you are on tight budget.Pro's -•apple watch look•nearly perfect heart rate and other tracking with 2-3 beats difference•Good watch faces• very light you won't feel you wore it all day long.Cons -Strap quality is not good but you can change itBattery life is not 9 days it's exact 7 days.Overall it's decent watch one could get at this price range.

  It's and extremely nice smart watch..if u budget is around 4k..I brought this for 3,500 during the launch period in the sale.. everything ..the features depicted above are very true..Everything like abt sports mode,sleep tracking,heart beat tracking..(expect spO2..common..u jst can't complain something at this budget.. however it is 90% accurate for.most of the time)The features which i personally feel lacks here is:-1) this watch doesn't come with always on display Nd plus wen u lift ur hand up.. it takes a dealy of abt 1 sec to show watch face..2) doesn't have inbuilt GPS..so trekking people..wait for the pro version of this watch to come..or buy another watch..3)if u r completely using the watch.i.mean all the sports mode..then the battery ain't enough for u..But i know..u won't do every outdoor activity in a single day..<U+0001F605><U+0001F605>That's all..But believe me..u won't regret after buying this...if u have the watch's specifications as ur requirements..<U+0001F917><U+0001F917>

  SpO2 measurement is a big task. Eight out of ten times you will get measurement problem. Accuracy is not good. Heart rate, steps count is Ok. Battery died on the end of 6th day. Product feel is good. If you are purchasing this for spO2 measurement, you should no,Hope Amazefit will improve on next update.

  I have used the watch now for 2 months. And I had been on the fence about keeping it or selling it - depends on how is the OnePlus watch is.First some good points: Love the look of it. Display is really good, bright and colourful. And I like the square design. There are a lot of physical activity modes + HR + SPO2 monitor but since I use just the basic running, walking and free exercise modes remaining doesn't matter. For SPO2, I would rather use the another monitor than to rely on this.Bad points - Software is really buggy. I had MI band and Honor Bands and both were really good. But very disappointed with the software. Step counts are massively wrong. Worse is that you may reach your goal of say 8k steps as per the watch and would be happy. But next day, watch will decide that no - you didn't. It will show something like 7k steps. Sleep tracking used to be accurate - but for last 10 days it is just unable to track sleep. I have reset my watch but no use. Never got the call notification to work on my watch - tried every advise available in internet but no avail.Anyway I loved the look of the watch but as soon as I get an alternative in this form factor I am ditching it.

  A really cool looking Smartwatch for such a low price (got mine for 3.5k) loaded with fitness tracking features, stylish watch faces and robust material. The display is not totally impressive though and the SPO2 meter struggles to do its job. Overall, for such low price, this is an above average gadget that doesn't fail to impress !

  Limited Watch Faces.Only 4 watch face can be selected in watch. In which 2 are system selected so you have choice for keep only 2 watch faces in the watch.Only 3 Customize Watch Faces available for change wallpaper of your choice.Very big con is \"Not supporting Indian languages\"Neither in App nor in Watch.You can't read messages of Indian languages.

  So, after using 4 days, I am writing this review. First of all 5<U+0001F31F> for Amazon delivery, safe and sound delivery during Covid time, purely contactless and polite delivery. Now, we come come to the watch.<U+0001F449> Looks:- Stunning, At first glance, you might get deceived with Apple i Watch, therefore a complete 4<U+0001F31F>. It has 50 variable faces with really viberant colours of skin make it awesome in your hand.<U+0001F449> Battery:- I did a full recharge and after 4 days it want one bar down, so far so good.<U+0001F449> Cost:- Here I think it deserves 3<U+0001F31F>, because, Amazon kept it a bit high, it can be 500 less or so and then more affordable.<U+0001F449> Functions:- Right from monitoring sleep quality, which is a bit boring because it tells about deep and light sleep, which will make you somewhat nervous, if your sleep score goes below 70, to controling music playback of my phone or taking pictures spy pictures using my phone with the help of operating my watch are just awesome qualities.So, I am ok with the watch.<U+0001F449>

  This is my first smart watch and I purchased it after seeing many review on you tube and digital media. The watch has very much matched the hype it has created. My observations :-1. Good and Bright Display2.Sensors are almost accurate3. Multiple watch faces are available4. Can be paired with Google Fit5. No GPS means a compulsion to carry Phone for activities6.Watch strap causing lot of itching

  Display good but not full screen type.. it would been better if it occupies full screen display.. accuracy is ok.. not excellent. Battery also ok. Can last 4 to 5 days with good use. If less used daily then stand 9 to 10 days. 3.5k is reasonable price but not worth above that price. The watch is tiny than expected from images. Not suited for people with good wrist size . Cannot download other watch faces using zepp app. Showing download failed everytime.

  This watch comes with great features at affordable price but function like blood oxygen and Stress measurement works only if you put this watch very tightly on your wrist.Overall it's good buy ignoring above with its interface and other functionalities.

  OkayI am reviewing after using this for 30 days of use.Sleep Accuracy is not efficient it gives 90% correct data but I am not happy with 10% of inaccuracy as it counts sleeping even when you are just laying down in night and watching moviesStep count is accurate like 98%Heart Beat count sometimes when you intentionally try to read the activity it fails also happens with Stress and Spo2 countOverall good 3.5/5 as it fails when I try intentionally by following the instructions.Battery life is 7 days I charge it on every Tuesday from past 3 weeks as it drains out completely on TuesdayI can say I light up the screen for around 30-40 mins a day and heart rate count is enabled by default on 30 mins setting

  One Of the best available Smartwatch Under This price Segment!I got the watch on next day of ordering so thank you Amazon for that.Design & Built - Well all plastic body but durable and silicon straps are very comfortableYou won't feel the watch on your wrist! It's so lightweightSoftware - The software experience is way better than its competitors, Simple, Smooth, Refined! (I got 2 Update for the watch via Zepp app)Plenty of watch faces to choose fromApp alerts are there ( you can read SMS, Whatsapp notification in the watch but there's no reply option)Call cancellation, mute, hangup message feature availableFunctions and Accuracy - this is the most important aspect of the smartwatch! I have been using it enough time now and i found it very accurate! Well i compared Spo2 results with real Pulse Oximeter and the difference was about of 10% it's the same for HR monitoring, Stress measurement features is there which i didnt found useful,Other things which is there areAlarm, Exercise, Weather, Rise to wake, Menstrual cycle Monitoring, count down, stopwatch,Battery - well company is saying it will last for 9 day's but mine was lasted for only 3 days! It can be because of the defective unit! (Reviewer saying it last almost 5 to 8 days)Charging speed is good. It completed the full charge under 2.14 minIf your budget is under 4k then you can definitely look for this watch or you can wait for the pro versionThanks

  Here you will get the answers of all your questions popping in your mind. I have spent lot of time in watching the review videos on youtube. And after watching approx 30 videos (or more) here is the result-If your budget is under 3,000 (and you cant raise it) then you can go for mi band 5 (it doesnt have spo2) or honor band (it has Spo2).Now if your budget is under 4000 then maybe you considerd noisefit endure. This is also good if you want circular dial (just for show off). And function is pathetic. For sport modes, it only measures your heart rate and you will get no detailed data. So it will be waste to purchase it. And if your budget is above 4000 then you have lots of option.Now coming to the watch...Display-First of all I would like to tell you about the display. Never think that you will get very cheap display quality (which I thaught before purchasing) as its look in the pictures. Though its not amoled but still the display is very bright and you will love it. If you are worried about display, then trust me you can go for it, its really awesome.So for display - 5 <U+2B50>Accuracy-Heart rate, spo2, stress and sleep monitoring all are pretty much accurate . Just you have to be careful while wearing it because wearing it properly only gives you accurate result. Though the spo2 monitoring failed sometime when I tried to measure (-1<U+2B50>).But overall its good and accurate.So for accuracy - 4<U+2B50>Battery-It wont last for 9 days but with all functions enabled it will give you upto 4-5 days of backup. Dont consider 9 days as less as compared to other bands and previous bip series it has bigger display.So for battery- 4<U+2B50>App-Its good but it shows some of the features tha are visible even when they are not supported which reduces the user experience and makes it a bit confusing.So for app- 4<U+2B50>Watch UI-Its very awesome and easy to use.So for UI- 5<U+2B50>Watch faces and others-<U+25AA><U+FE0E>You get lots of watch faces and custom watchfaces too making the endless possibility for the watch faces.<U+25AA><U+FE0E>Watch strap is also very good and soft. Watch is very light to wear. You are not going to feel that you are wearing a watch.<U+25AA><U+FE0E>You get 60 +sports mode.Overall you can go for it.[Update after 7 days of use-]1. Battery is good. It runs for 5 days in my case.2. One thing is dissapointing, the screen is not scratch resistant. It developed scratches. It must be used with a screen guard. Rest is good so far.

  Purchased this watch for gifting purpose. Feature packed, loads of sensors, awesome battery life and everything about the watch is likeable except that it feels a bit cheap but that makes it more suited for daily use compared to costlier options. I'd happily pay 1k extra for AMOLED display.

  Great product for the price. Works pretty well and all the trackers and functions are good. The app is easy to use and once your device is added you can check everything in detail. The watch faces are cool and the battery backup is decent as well. I charged it 10 days ago and still have around 25%, I don't consider myself to be a heavy user though. You can kill this before the claimed hours if u make the best use of the features. I do miss an always on display, but the display quality on this one is pretty good.

  The display is ridiculously small with big bezels, no always on display feature, build quality feels cheap, battery backup is really bad and charging time is way too much, the watch doesn't show incoming calls most of the time and misses out notifications from other apps too, there is no auto reply option for messages.Over-all not a good buy.

  Amazfit Bip U review.Review time - 3 daysPros:* Accurate Tracking.* Awesome display with deep blacks and great touch response.* Curved glass with anti fingerprint coating* App integration and app working* Build quality good for price range* Magnetic pin charging* Vibration motor is strong and can be felt easilyCons:* Battery- with all tracking continuously on and all notifications allowed, expect 3 days battery life. Normal to medium use yet to be tested.*Straps are very good but I find it irritating when it sticks to skin with sweat. Might not be a problem for others.* Fit and finish could have been a bit better but I’m nitpicking.Verdict: I’d recommend this in the range of 3-4K cause both hardware and software is excellent. No issues with both iOS and Android.My score: 9/10

  Been about 3 weeks since I've bought and used it, works perfectly for what I was looking for. I don't care about the tracking and fitness aspects as much. I was looking for a decent FIRST smart watch to get, and this one is pretty much perfect. Notifications etc. work as intended. The range is similar to that of any bluetooth 5.0 headphone. If you're considering this watch and worried if it has any issues, don't worry. It works fine.

  I have been using watch for 4 months now and I can say that watch is decent but there are few problems too.Steps count, calorie count all works nice but heart rate sensors acts funny(drops to 60 from 130 suddenly in exercise mode) at a time so that causes problem in calories count to while exercise.Also let me tell that all watches count your walking steps by hand movement until you put it on walking or outdoor running mode in workout.If continuous heart rate is set to capture heart rate in every minute or 5 min then do not expect a good battery performance. Though this is the story with all smartwatch.

  I like the amazefit Bip U smartwatch. Before unbox, I was so much aggressive for this inbox content & first impression of smartwatch. I thought the watch is built up of metal frame but very disappointed when saw in the box, is it plastic built. I want the green colour very much but not available in the stock since 1st sale on Amazon. The features are outanding but the accuracy level of all the parameters are little bit deviate sometimes. At this price range 3499, it is costly than other brands (Boat storm & Noise). I am given 3.5 out of 5 for overall rating for this product.

  Till now I have used MI and Honor smart bands, this is the first smartwatch from Amazfit.  after one week of use I am writing this review.Pros:1. Best display (TFT)  in outdoor and indoor environments.2. build quality is good very lightweight and watch stripes are not bad.3. steps accuracy is ok.4. Spo2 is accuracy is ok. when I test with other bands and other Spo2 measuring instruments maintained ±5 to ±10% accuracy).Cons:1. stress measurement option is good but failed to measure many times.2. I disappointed mainly with it is not at all tracking cycling. (i traveled by cycle for 10km but it is showing only 0.91km).3. battery is only 4days lasted with advanced sleeping monitoring(mentioned 9 days).it is a package of all features but improvement required. decide ur self.

I will recommend this to buy if you are buying smart watch for first time to try it out.No always on feature available with this watch.

  Good trackerI play badminton in the mornings. It shows the summary of the complete exercise with detailed heart rate variation, calories, steps etc.during playing I can pause it between game to game for improving accuracy.Oxygen monitor is perfect.It shows stress rate also, don’t know how accurate is it as I cannot cross check with other devices.During office while I am sitting it reminds me periodically to stand up and stretch.Overall experience after 2 weeks is good.Don’t know about sleep as I don’t wear it during night. My sleep is always good.
